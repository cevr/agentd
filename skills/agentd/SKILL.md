description: AI agent task scheduler via macOS launchd. Use when scheduling agent tasks, managing scheduled jobs, viewing task logs, or any interaction with the `~/.agentd/` directory. Triggers on "agentd", "schedule agent", "schedule task", "agent scheduler", "launchd agent".

# agentd

Schedule AI agent tasks (Claude, Codex) via macOS launchd plist files. Each task becomes a plist that fires `agentd run <id>`, which invokes the agent in the original working directory.

## Quick Reference

| Command | What it does |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `agentd "<prompt>" -s "<schedule>"` | Schedule task (default: claude) |
| `agentd "<prompt>" -s "<schedule>" -p codex` | Schedule with specific provider |
| `agentd ls` | List all tasks |
| `agentd ls --json` / `agentd ls -j` | List tasks as JSON |
| `agentd rm <id>` | Remove task + unload plist |
| `agentd run <id>` | Execute task (called by launchd) |
| `agentd logs` | List available logs |
| `agentd logs <id>` | View task log |
| `agentd logs <id> -f` | Tail task log |

## Scheduling

### Schedule Formats

Natural language (preferred):

| Pattern | Type | Example |
| ------- | ---- | ------- |
| `in N minutes/hours/days` | Oneshot | `in 30 minutes` |
| `tomorrow at HH:mm[am\|pm]` | Oneshot | `tomorrow at 9am` |
| `every day at HH:mm[am\|pm]` | Recurring | `every day at 9:00` |
| `every weekday at HH:mm` | Recurring | `every weekday at 9am` |
| `every {day} at HH:mm` | Recurring | `every monday at 10:30am` |

5-field cron fallback: `min hour dom month dow`

| Cron | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `0 9 * * 1-5` | Weekdays at 9am |
| `*/30 * * * *` | Every 30 min |
| `0 0 1 * *` | First of month midnight |

### Providers

| Flag | CLI invoked |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `-p claude` (default) | `claude -p <prompt> --dangerously-skip-permissions --model sonnet` |
| `-p codex` | `codex exec -C <cwd> --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` |

## Management

- Tasks stored at `~/.agentd/tasks/{id}.json`
- Plists at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cvr.agentd-{id}.plist`
- `agentd rm <id>` unloads plist, deletes task file, and cleans up log file
- Oneshot tasks auto-complete after first run
- `install` is atomic: rolls back to previous plist if `launchctl load` fails
- `uninstall` verifies unload succeeded before removing plist — won't orphan running jobs

## Logs

- Log files at `~/.agentd/logs/{id}.log`
- Both stdout and stderr go to the same log file
- `agentd logs` lists all available log files
- `agentd logs <id> -f` tails in real-time

## Architecture

```
src/
  main.ts                    # CLI entry + layer wiring
  paths.ts                   # shared path resolution (HOME, dirs)
  errors/index.ts            # AgentdError (tagged)
  output.ts                  # NO_COLOR + TTY detection
  commands/
    index.ts                 # root (= add) + subcommands
    list.ts                  # ls
    remove.ts                # rm (+ log cleanup)
    run.ts                   # run (internal, fired by plist)
    logs.ts                  # logs
  services/
    Schedule.ts              # pure NL/cron parser
    Store.ts                 # task CRUD (~/.agentd/tasks/)
    Launchd.ts               # plist gen + launchctl (atomic install/uninstall)
    AgentPlatform.ts         # agent invocation (provider arg builders)
```

## Gotchas

- `agentd` binary conflicts with nothing, but ensure `~/.bun/bin` is in PATH for launchd
- Plist `EnvironmentVariables` includes HOME and PATH — `PathEnv` inherits `process.env.PATH` at build time
- `Schedule` is a pure module, not a `ServiceMap.Service`
- Task IDs must be alphanumeric, hyphens, or underscores only
- Oneshot tasks auto-unload their plist after first run
- Weekday range `1-5` expands to 5 separate `StartCalendarInterval` entries
- `store.list` warns on corrupt task files to stderr — doesn't silently drop
- `NO_COLOR=1` suppresses decorative output (separator lines in `ls`)
- `generatePlist` and `escapeXml` are `@internal` exports for testability
- Provider args are extracted into `claudeArgs`/`codexArgs` — extend in `AgentPlatform.ts`
